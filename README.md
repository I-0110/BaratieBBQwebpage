# BaratieBBQwebpage
My first completed HTML project with some CSS details.
## Resorces for creating this project
I used the mini project given in WebX course from CodingX App to create a gym
   webpage. 
## Details of the project
1) It starts with a folder named after the final project, "Baratie BBQ".
2) Then, inside this folder we add a "css", "images", and "src" folders.
3) Before start to write the code, I created a map plan. I write and draw in a paper
   what it needs to contain to make it usable, why I am doing this webpage for, and how
   I would like to see my final webpage. 
4) I created a index and contact info on html format on the "src folder". These eventually
   will be the main page and a link to add the contact info. of the client.
